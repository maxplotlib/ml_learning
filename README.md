# 🧠 ML/DS Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.
This repo contains code experiments from various tutorials and courses.

## 🎯 Goal
To progressively build my skills in data science, from Python fundamentals to deploying interactive machine learning applications.

## 📚 Main Learning Resources
- **Book:** *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* — Aurélien Géron  
- **Tutorials:** MOOCs and YouTube courses (e.g. Coursera, freeCodeCamp, statquest, etc.)  
- **Frameworks:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Streamlit, FastAPI and more ...

## 📚 Subfolders
- `hands-on-ml/` → Exercises and code from *Hands-On Machine Learning* (Aurélien Géron)  
- `streamlit_basics/` → Experiments and mini-apps built with Streamlit  
- `python_api_development/` → Fundamentals of API design (routes, serialization/deserialization, schema validation, and models) to build a backend clone of a social media app using FastAPI
- `ml_playground/` → Practice notebooks and experimental projects from various tutorials and courses 
- `llm_engineering_fundamentals/` → from text processing and embeddings to RAG systems.

## 🧩 Note
This repository mainly includes **course reproductions** and **practice notebooks**.  
The purpose is to **consolidate my understanding** before developing **personal projects** in ML and data applications.

## ⚙️ Install requirements
To set up the environment, run:

```bash
